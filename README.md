# Echen's Blog

This is my personal blog made with Jekyll using a personally modified [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). The website is hosted on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions, as this website uses plugins that cannot directly handle GitHub Pages deployment.

The website can be found at https://echen.io.
