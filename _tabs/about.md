Hi! My name is Eric. I am a rising freshman at the University of Maryland, where I will be studying Computer Engineering. This blog is for me to share things I like and find interesting. You'll find an assortment of topics; feel free to look around. This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, with some modifications. If you have any questions, contact me at ericchen314@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
