Hi! My name is Eric. I am a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland. This blog is for me to share things I like and find interesting. You'll find an assortment of topics, so feel free to look around. This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, with some modifications. If you have any questions, contact me at ericchen314 at gmail dot com.

Enjoy!
