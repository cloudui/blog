Hi! My name is Eric. I am a rising freshman at the University of Maryland, where I will be studying Computer Engineering. This blog is for me to share things I like and find interesting. You'll find an assortment of topics; feel free to look around. This website was made using Jekyll and the Chirpy theme, with some modifications. If you have any questions, contact me at ericchen314@gmail.com.

My old site can be found at [blog.echen.io](https://blog.echen.io), which was made using Django and is littered with typos and grammar mistakes. I will keep it online, but it probably won't get updated much.

Enjoy!
