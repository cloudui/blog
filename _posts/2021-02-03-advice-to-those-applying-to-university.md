It looks like you're going to start to apply to college soon. It's  going to be a rough ride but there are a couple of tips I'd like to give you just so you can feel more confident about it. Some of this advice  will primarily apply to students at Montgomery Blair, but feel free to  look for the parts that apply to you. 

First, a little bit of background. I applied to 13 colleges in total: 2 early decisions and 11 regular decisions. They were as follows.

## Early Action:

1. University of Maryland
2. Stanford 

## Regular Decision:

1. Carnegie Mellon
2. Johns Hopkins
3. Harvard
4. Princeton
5. University of Pennsylvania
6. Massachusetts Institute of Technology
7. Northwestern
8. Brown
9. Duke
10. Columbia
11. Cornell

There are quite a few reasons my list consists of these particular  colleges. I will explain why but don't feel pressured to model yours off of it (you don't know how qualified I am yet as most decisions are not  out). Generally, most people would want a combination of safety schools, target schools, and reach schools (names are self-explanatory).  Generally, if you have a safe school you're comfortable going to, I  advise that you only apply to one as it will not be worth the effort to  apply to others. For most people in MoCo, UMD would be your pick for  this one. It is one of the top-ranked public universities in the nation, nearby, and easy to get into (provided you are a semi-decent student).  If you are in Blair, do not be worried, you'll almost definitely get in  if you're reading this. 

Target schools are those that you feel capable of getting into but  are not guaranteed. For students with good GPAs and extracurriculars  would probably aim towards mid to top-tier colleges, including schools  like Georgia Tech and Northeastern. I did not apply to any target  schools, so take my advice with a grain of salt. For most, I would  advise applying to only a few target schools, enough so that you feel  comfortable getting into one, but don't dwell too much on it. UMD is  already an excellent college, and honestly, it's better than most  mid-tier schools. 

I find that most people spend their time on prestigious universities, but then again, my friend circle is brimming with hyper-accomplished  students. Most people apply to quite a few. These universities are  almost always reach schools, which probably means your acceptance is  down to luck (for most students, that is). Schools include all your  Ivies, MIT, Stanford, etc. There are quite a lot to choose from and a  lot of research for you to do to see which ones you like. 

 

## So which ones should I apply to?

Well, it depends on who you are. I'll lay out a few strategies and  you can either take your pick or devise your own. If you are perfectly  comfortable going to UMD and have a couple reach schools that you'd  consider, you probably don't need to apply to that many. I know of some  who just applied to ~5 colleges for that exact reason. If you're set on  making a top-tier college, I recommend UMD and a handful of top-tier  colleges, and maybe a couple targets if you don't really want to go to  UMD. I myself applied to 1 safety school and 12 reach schools because I  am perfectly happy with going to UMD, and anything else is just extra.  That's why you don't see any mid-tier or mid-to-top tier schools on my  list. From what I've heard, most people in MoCo apply to 7-15 schools. 

There are obviously many different majors as well. If you are a  stellar musician, you would probably not apply to the same schools as a  prospective engineer. The schools you choose to apply to are based on  what you would like to do. If you're a diehard artist, then something  like CalTech is not for you. You're going to need to do a lot of  research. I recommend accessing the university's homepage, blogs of  alumni, [college subreddits,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/) or online guides/lists (like USNews). If you have friends or family who went to or currently attend university, they can be an invaluable asset to your application process. Try to reach out as much as possible; it  can't hurt you. 

I recommend [Fiske's Guide to Colleges](https://www.amazon.com/Fiske-Guide-Colleges-2021-Edward/dp/1492664960) for some basic research. It's a comprehensive guide of all the  universities in the United States. It will tell you about price ranges,  general academic markers, and the specialties of each school. You can  purchase it with the link or pirate it with Libgen. But I didn't tell  you about the latter. 

Also, don't just go off of what I have said. Ask other seniors or  recent graduates as well. Talk to your parents and friends to get their  perspective. After all, that's where most of my information came from.  Don't stress too much about it; you'll get the gist eventually.

 

## The Mindset

I genuinely believe that having the mindset that you must go to a  top-tier college is harmful. Most people don't end up at the best  schools and that's okay. Being a hard worker at a lower-tier college can net you many benefits and may even be better suited towards you.  However, it's really hard not to have this mindset in Montgomery County  due to the vast amount of accomplished individuals and I am honestly  part of the problem. I think the best thing to remember is that you will be okay. When you look back at yourself in 50 years, which college you  went to won't be in the top 10 most important events in your life. 

This doesn't mean you shouldn't try for the top-tier colleges. If  you're capable, why not? Just note that it likely isn't as important as  others make it out to be. I rode the hype train and honestly, the only  reason I want to make it into a top-tier college is just for my ego. I  don't necessarily think it will net me a better education overall. If  even I think I will be fine, you should have confidence in yourself. 

 

## Early and Regular Decisions. What's the difference?

So there are a couple differences and I'll try to explain it as best  as I can, as there is often some confusion surrounding this topic. Early applications have an earlier deadline (around November 1st) and are  split into two categories: **Early Decision (ED) and Early Action (EA).** ED schools are binding schools. If you apply and get in with the early  decision, you are legally bound to that school and cannot go to another. They are usually your top pick, as you will not have the flexibility to choose another university if you get in. If you don't...then you will  have that flexibility. Early Action schools are also submitted early but are not binding. It's just getting your decision earlier. 

So what's the benefit? Generally, ED and EA appear to give you a  higher chance of admission, as you are showing high interest in the  school. But don't be fooled; the acceptance rate probably won't be the  deciding factor. Furthermore, you just get your decision way earlier, so you can determine how to proceed with the application process depending on whether you get in or not. You can only apply to one ED school, so  be sure it's your top choice. Most EA schools are restrictive, meaning  you can also only apply to one, but private schools like MIT and Caltech and most public schools allow you to apply to more than one (just make  sure the others are not restrictive). Note the difference between public and private universities. Restrictive EA for private universities means you can still EA to public universities. They are independent of one  another. Most people will either pick EA or ED, but the possibility of  applying to both may suit your needs. Many of my friends applied to 4+  schools early.

Regular Decisions have a later application deadline, usually due  around January 1st. But check the school you are applying to, as some  may have a deadline earlier or even much later. You can apply to  everything else you didn't apply to in ED/EA, with almost no  restrictions. But since most ED/EA decisions are released before January 1st, make sure you modify your strategy accordingly. Say you got  accepted into your ED school. There is no further need for you to apply  to any other schools, as you cannot attend them anyway. Just be happy  that you are done. If you get in EA, you can still apply to more  schools, as it will give you more options later down the line if you do  get into any of your RD schools. But it is completely up to you whether  you want to do that or not. 

Most of my friends applied EA as it gives you more flexibility. But  if you really have that dream school and it is ED, go right on ahead. I  believe in you. But if you have the choice of EA or ED for the same  school, EA is probably the way to go.

 

# The Application Process: What is my timeline?

There are five key aspects of the application process:

1. Planning 
2. Filling out Common App/other portals
3. Essays and supplementals
4. Teacher Recommendations
5. Transcripts and Test Scores

The college process is quite simple, but it can easily overwhelm you. Since essays will be the most difficult and time-consuming portion of  your app, start with the others first. I recommend asking your teachers  for recommendations as early as you can. If you can get it done before  your junior year ends, that would be ideal. I requested my  recommendations in August, which is still fine, but the earlier the  better. They don't have to fill them out until the deadline for your  colleges but make sure they know they are writing you one.

The next step is the planning process. You need to decide which  colleges you want to apply to. Look at my advice from earlier. I stress  that you need to make sure you are willing to go to the schools you  apply to. There is no reason for filler; it will only waste your time.  After you decide on a rough list, highlight the ones you are definitely  applying to and the schools you will apply to early. If you are unsure  whether you will apply to a college, it's fine. You will have time to  decide.

Get started on your common app. Most schools will use the common app. You will need to fill in a lot of personal information, including your  grades, academics, and honors. This shouldn't take very long. You can  obviously update achievements as you go, but fill out the trivial stuff  as soon as you can. At this point, you should request transcripts for  the schools you are set on. You can do it as you go, but make sure to  submit the request on Naviance (for MoCo students) at least 20 days in  advance. Make sure you know which schools require direct test scores for APs, SATs, ACTs, or what-not because you will need to request scores  from College Board (etc.) and have your scores sent to your schools.  This will cost a bit of cash.

The steps above are quite easy but are annoying. Just get them done  early so you don't have to stress about them like I did. Making a  spreadsheet detailing your actions will help you greatly. 

 

## Essays of Death

The next step is your essays. The common app essay is the default BIG essay where you discuss something really important about yourself. It's 650 words and will take a long time. You must make sure you have a  unique and interesting idea. The prompts are [here.](https://www.commonapp.org/apply/essay-prompts) The prompts are vague enough that you can literally talk about  anything, so make sure it stands out. You can probably find better  advice for how to write essays from other people, so I won't go into the details here. Know that there will be a lot of editing and rewriting.  Put yourself on a piece of paper and be interesting.

Each school will have supplemental essays, which can range from just  one to eight (thanks, Stanford) or more essays. Some will be short  (50ish words) and some will be long (400-600 words). Common prompts  include: "Why us?", "Name a contribution to your community.", "How will  you integrate into [the school's] community?", and "describe your  background". Each essay will require a lot of brainstorming and a lot of writing, so be prepared for the long haul. Generally, you will want to  work on one school at a time. You will be able to reuse essays and  snippets across multiple schools, so plan out the most efficient path  for you to conquer them all. 

The bulk of your time will probably be editing, depending on your  writing level. Try to use good rhetoric and emphasize your unique  writing style. You will need to research colleges and learn a lot about  them to write about them. For the "Why us" questions, read about clubs,  the community, classes, and programs. Make a list of the things you  liked and connect these ideas to who you are today. Again, I'm not going to include too many writing tips here, as I'm probably not the best  person to ask. Good sources include the [CollegeEssayGuy](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/) and [CollegeVine](https://blog.collegevine.com/), but the best resources will likely be your friends and graduates. Ask for help-- it'll really save your ass some trouble. 

I would like to reiterate that the essays are time-consuming. Try to  start at least a month before your deadline. You will spend weeks  polishing, writing, and refining. Doing things earlier will take the  stress off your shoulders and really help you stay calm as the deadlines approach. If you have trouble writing yourself, ask a friend to help  brainstorm. There's no harm in doing that. Once you're done with a  school, you will be able to submit. Save some time to look over your  common app and fix your mistakes. Nervously chide yourself that you did  everything correctly as you enter in your credit card information and  click the submit button. 

This is just a broad outline of things you will need to do. I have  not really provided much insight because you will collect it as you move along the process. I'm always here if you want to reach out and I'd be  happy to talk to you or even look at your essays. But I hope I can  instill some confidence into you as these hard months approach. Having  an outline of what needs to be done can be greatly beneficial and it's  something I wish I had. 

I did not do a great job during the college application process. I  did not even begin writing my common app until three weeks before my  first deadline and I did not settle on a final idea until two before. I  was extremely anxious and incredibly exhausted. I was still writing on  the last day in the last hour before the clock struck 12. After I  finished my first college, I took too long of a break as I was tired  beyond belief. For my regular decision colleges, I turned everything in  the day it was due less than an hour before the deadline. I had seldom  time to polish my essays and relied on massive help from my sister and  her boyfriend. Despite this, I believe I was able to crank out some  pretty solid essays, but they definitely could have been better if I  allotted my time wisely. I believe you can learn from my mistakes. 

After you finish applications, the bulk of the work is done. 

 

## Interviews

The last step is the interviews. Shortly after you apply to colleges, alumni will email you for interviews. This can take a couple weeks, so  be patient. Many schools will offer you the choice to opt-out, but I  don't recommend it. Interviews are an opportunity for you to show the  schools what you are like in person, so you should take it to your  advantage. The interviewer will ask you questions and report back to the school with an essay about your conversation. Although it was over Zoom for my year, it will likely return to in-person meetings at a coffee  shop or a restaurant. From what I've heard, most alumni do not know the  scope of their effect on your decision. From what I've heard, a bad  interview can screw you over, but a good one probably won't do too much. These are rumors, so take it with a giant grain of salt. Brush up on  the school's interview policies because some schools don't have them or  might not have space to offer you one.

I highly recommend studying up on the school before your interview.  Know how to answer the commonly asked questions, like "describe  yourself" or "why did you apply to [this school]" or "what is your  biggest weakness." Conversations will likely be very chill so you don't  need to be worried. Try to act human; you don't want to make yourself  seem too perfect. Talk to them like you're meeting your parents'  friends. The interviewer isn't going to intentionally trip you up. The  interviewers are trying to see if you're a good fit for the school and  whether they like you, so don't spend the entire hour flexing your  achievements or iterating your resume. I recommend memorizing a couple  experiences or activities that show growth or something important about  you. By doing this, you can direct any question at one of these topics  and engage the interviewer with meaningful and interesting stories. Look online and learn how to build rapport and be confident. One great  YouTube channel for this is [Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/user/charismaoncommand), from whom I learned many tricks. 

Try to stand out. Instead of saying "I'm doing well," say "I'm doing  fantastic" or something descriptive that most people wouldn't say. You  want to leave a good impression and have a nice conversation. Interviews shouldn't be terribly stressful. Put yourself in a good mood before  meeting your interviewers-- it'll go a long way. Once you have finished, you're essentially done. You can still add achievements to some schools but all there is to do is wait. I'm in that process now. You should  find meaningful and interesting activities in the meantime since it will be your last semester in high school. Have some fun!

 

## Closing Thoughts

Remember: the college application process isn't complicated, it's  just tedious. Doing things upfront will reduce the stress for your  future self. Being organized will make you confident that you are doing  things correctly and efficiently. Feel free to email me at **"eric chen 314 at gmail dot com"** if you have any questions or would like some advice. I might not be the best person for advice but I am certainly willing to help you do better than I did. I am also willing to share with you my common app should  you request to see it.

Best of luck!
