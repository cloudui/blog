A bunch of random stuff goes here now.
{% highlight python %}
def DFS(self, v):
    # Create a set to store visited vertices
    visited = set()
 
    # Call the recursive helper function
    # to print DFS traversal
    self.DFSUtil(v, visited)
{% endhighlight %}
Our injection is after ORDER BY, so the only fields we control are ORDER BY, LIMIT, INTO, and FOR. INTO and FOR are both pretty much useless for conveying information. LIMIT cannot be an expression, so it can’t be used for sending data. That leaves the ORDER BY clause.

Since we have to specify a valid column for the first ORDER BY, and each column has unique values, it seems like we won’t be able to control the ordering. However, we can add on to the expression to make it always return the same value and force it to use the secondary sort column. I chose to use IS NOT NULL. With this, we can sort by an arbitrary value. Let’s try just sorting randomly:
